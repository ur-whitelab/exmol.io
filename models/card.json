{"title": "Solubility Prediction", "details": "Solubility predictor with uncertainty. Model is a bidirectional LSTM that predict standard deviation and mean. An esnemble of 5 is combined for predictions. Epistemic uncertainty comes from model disagreement.", "use": "Small organic molecules", "factors": "Model may not generalize to large molecules", "metrics": "Test correlation 0.80. Test MAE 1.78", "evaluation": "Withheld examples (test data)", "training": "9982 molecules, which was augmented to 96552 molecules.", "caveats": "?", "ethics": "None noted"}
